# About Me
I am currently a third-year **Computer Science** major in **Warren** college. I enjoy traveling but have no occasion in a while because of the pandemic. I like watching movies, reading novels, playing video games, and working out in my spare time. I have a corgi back in China who is taken care of by my parents now.
